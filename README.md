# **Faulty Calculator**

## **Overview**

The Faulty Calculator is a fun and interactive JavaScript project designed to enhance learning. It works like a normal calculator but introduces a 10% error rate, making incorrect calculations in a controlled manner.

## **Features**

- **Intentional Calculation Errors:**

With a 10% probability, the calculator randomly swaps operators:
* → /
- → +
/ → -
+ → *

- **Adaptive Equation Display:**

If the equation length exceeds the container, it shrinks to fit.
Once the font size reaches 30px, a scroll appears instead.

- **Quick Estimate Panel:**

Displays large decimal numbers with an approximate value (up to 3 decimal places) for better readability.



## **Technologies Used**

- HTML – Structure of the calculator

- CSS – Styling and responsive adjustments

- JavaScript – Functional logic for calculations and errors


## **How It Works**

1. Enter numbers and operators as you would on a normal calculator.

2. Perform calculations, but expect occasional faulty results (due to the 10% error rule).

3. Observe the equation shrink dynamically if it exceeds the display width.

4. If numbers are too long, use the Quick Estimate Panel to see a rounded version.
